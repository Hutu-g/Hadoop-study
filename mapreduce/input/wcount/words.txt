Long Holidays Generally 
speaking long holidays are good for us college 
students On the one hand we have a lot of 
time to study by ourselves 
and thus improve weaknesses 
and further develop strengths
On the other hand we can
take part-time jobs which can make 
us realize responsibility and 
make ourselves better prepared for 
social life But every coin has two sides 
Some students fail to make good use of their time
and they are addicted to 
various computer games I am afraid that they 
are likely to ruin themselves in this way As far
as I am concerned I will try to make the 
best use of my precious time I will spend 
most of my holidays studying English for that I am very poor at it In addition I will take a 
part-time job as private teacher By this 
means I can earn some money and 
put my knowledge into practice as well
